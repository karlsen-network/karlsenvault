# KarlsenVault

KarlsenVault is a simple frontend interface for your Ledger device.

## Compatible Browsers

The browser needs to support WebUSB/WebHID so it can interact with
the Ledger device. These are the known compatible browsers:

## Development and Running Locally

You will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to run this locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your
browser to start using or developing KarlsenVault locally.

## FAQ

### Are my funds safe with KarlsenVault?

Yes, but to be clear KarlsenVault itself does not store your
Karlsen. Your Karlsen is also not stored in the Ledger device as
well. When you send Karlsen (KLS) to the address you generate with
KarlsenVault, it is stored on the BlockDAG as a UTXO.
